  '6.“The dollar is round.” This was one of my grandfather’s adages, a Mortonism that people inside and outside Premier have shared and repeated over the years. It’s a reminder that money has a way of rolling in and rolling out. It definitely applies to challenges like innovation, when it can be easy to turn on the money spigot in hopes that just a little more investment will push your project over the top and turn an apparent failure into a success. Yes, you have to spend money to make money. But you’d better make sure that there’s a clear purpose for every dollar you spend,and a likely payback coming. Since the dollar is round, you never know when it will bounce your way or roll away, out of sight. So when you are lucky enough to have it, use it wisely, save some of it for tomorrow, and give generously to those in need.',

  '13.Being a successful business leader isn’t all about mental and emotional toughness—essential as those are.

  '14. Business isn’t always about being frivolous. When times are tough, the best way to connect with people may be to be honest and authentic —to share your struggles with others who are affected by them.',

  '15. How does a family business continue to adapt successfully in a business world where nothing is certain except constant, unpredictable change?—turns out to have a simple, powerful answer: you build on the strengths that got you this far.',

  '16.“A part of you belongs to Premier.” This is another cherished Mortonism. My grandfather liked to speak these words over the office intercom every Friday afternoon and before every work holiday. It was his way of encouraging us to enjoy quality time with family and friends, while not losing sight of the company we are proud to be a part of, and that we represent.',
